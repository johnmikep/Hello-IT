### Description:
A python implementation of com.github.ygini.hello-it.scriptlib.sh.
The helloit_lib.py is a basic wrapper around com.github.ygini.hello-it.scriptlib.sh allowing you to use the same
functions you would via bash. There may be a far better way to accomplish this but this works for my use case and helped make sense of using python scripts with Hello IT. 

Note: The included scripts use py3 which you would have to include to use.

### Usage:
Create a file in /Library/Application\ Support/com.github.ygini.hello-it/CustomScripts and import the HelloIT class

from helloit_lib import HelloIT

The included examples should show a few use cases.
